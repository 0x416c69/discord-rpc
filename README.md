Discord RPC Sample
==================

This is a lib and a couple of quick demos, one that implements the very minimal subset to show
current status, and one that is more complete. The idea here is to give you an lib that implements
the rpc connection and wraps sending events, and a basic example that uses it; you can use the lib
directly if you like, or use it as a guide to writing your own if it doesn't suit your game as is.
